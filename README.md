# MachineControlFW
A framework to create software for production equipment.

There is a test project Machine1 for demonstrating how to use the framework.

There is an additional project Wago BK that implements a driver for Wago 750-88x controllers using modbus on TcpIp.
This is used to simulate digital IO in the demo.


The project-setup is done for MS Visual Studio 2010.
